# Setup

- **Run `cargo install clgambling`** (for a better experience) (if you don't have it installed, install Rust via [**rustup**](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))
- **OR**
- **If you're on Windows, get the latest [release](https://github.com/HQ2000-Rust/CLG/releases/tag/0.1.0)** (not really recommended, but also possible, may be faster if you have a bad computer)
